* LAWMAKING TRACKED  EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
* centralized information helps people stay informed
* automatization can help citizens track and monitor legal initiatives
* making a closed and complex environment accessible to all
* increasing accountability among legislators

[See the project live](https://czl-web.surge.sh/)

With dozens of institutions involved in the process and incomplete information fragmented across a myriad of websites, it is almost impossible
for a regular citizen to follow the long process by which a proposal becomes law.

In these circumstances it is almost impossible to speak of active engagement in the legislative drafting process on the part of the citizens.

Right now people and entities interested in tracking legislation initiatives have to visit over 29 websites daily for updates. This places a large burden on legal
professionals, civil society actors and private corporations which are investing time and resources daily to stay up to date with legislation
initiatives. Once CeZiceLegea will be launched these costs will be reduced substantially.

CeZiceLegea aims to keep citizens informed at any time about changes in legislation and make them active participants in the legislative drafting process. Users will be able to track and
monitor proposed legislation through all the approval stages and be notified of the changes made.

As an extra feature, to give a sense of the wider context, CeZiceLegea will also allow access to current consolidated legislation.
